I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Collegio Superiore](http://www.collegio.unibo.it/it), University of Bologna, Italy.
I worked as a computer vision student researcher at the [Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.ram.eemcs.utwente.nl/) lab of the University of Twente, Netherlands, for the last three months of my bachelor's degree.
I graduated *summa cum laude* with my bachelor's in July 2020 and started my master's in September 2020.

While studying for my master's, I'm currently working as a TA for the [Software Engineering](https://archive.is/7O7eu) course for the BSc Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna.
In addition, I'm teaching high school CS theory and programming at [IIS Aldini Valeriani](http://www.iav.it/) in Bologna.
There, I'm also teaching a more advanced course in algorithms and data structures in order to prepare high school students for programming competitions.

When *I* was high school, doing competitive programming, I discovered the beauty of computational complexity theory, graph theory, dynamic programming and the like.
In college I delved into the study of computer architectures, which I find as fascinating as statistics and machine learning.
Mathematical and statistical modeling as well as low-level development thus became my primary interests.
I'm pursuing these interest both in college, exploring [experimental and computational economics](https://buponline.com/prodotto/astrazioni-stenografiche-2020/) and in my free time, contributing to some open source projects such as [GemRB](https://gemrb.org/).

In my free time I play the bass, cook or go running outside.
I like reading, watching movies, playing video games and going to the theater.
I also acted for a while.
I'm firmly convinced that practical work is an art form and this is why I strive to let the search for beauty and elegance guide me in my work.
