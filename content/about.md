I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Collegio Superiore](http://www.collegio.unibo.it/it), University of Bologna, Italy.
I worked as a computer vision student researcher at the [Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.ram.eemcs.utwente.nl/) lab of the University of Twente, Netherlands, for the last three months of my bachelor's degree.
I graduated *summa cum laude* with my bachelor's in July 2020 and started my master's in September 2020.

In high school, doing competitive programming, I discovered the beauty of computational complexity theory, graph theory, dynamic programming and the like.
In college I delved into the study of computer architectures, which I find as fascinating as statistics and machine learning.
Mathematical and statistical modeling as well as low-level development thus became my primary interests.

In my free time I play the bass, cook and go to the theater.
I also acted for a while.
I'm firmly convinced that practical work is an art form and this is why I strive to let the search for beauty and elegance guide me in my work.
